# I AM BROKE - SCRAPY

The goal of this project is to scrape a website.

A few years ago, I built a website [mondecadeaux.com](https://www.mondecadeaux.com) an affiliated e-commerce for the french public as a learning purpose.

That is why I made this project to easily scrape a website where I can find the images and URL of another similar USA website. [thisiswhyimbroke.com](https://www.thisiswhyimbroke.com/)

#### Python Libraries:

* Selenium
* Urllib
* Time
* Re
* Pandas

A [requirements.txt](https://github.com/marinapm90/im-broke-scrapy/blob/master/requirements.txt) file is included in the repository for easy installation.

#### Start up:

To use it you just need to run:

``python3 im_broke.py ``

And you will find a CSV on your computer with all the information.

#### Next steps:

To automate the publication of these products on my website.
