# I AM BROKE - SCRAPY

The goal of this project is to scrape a website.

A few years ago, I built a website [mondecadeaux.com](mondecadeaux.com) an affiliated e-commerce for the french public as a learning purpose.

That is why I made this project to easily scrape a website where I can find the images and URL of another similar USA website. [thisiswhyimbroke.com](thisiswhyimbroke.com)
